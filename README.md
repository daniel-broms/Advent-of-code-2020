To clone the  GitHub repository to your computer via RStudio
In RStudio, start a new Project:

File > New Project > Version Control > Git. In “Repository URL”, paste the URL of your new GitHub repository. It will be something like this https://github.com/jennybc/myrepo.git.
Do you NOT see an option to get the Project from Version Control? Restart RStudio and try again. Still no luck? Go to chapter 13 for tips on how to help RStudio find Git.
Accept the default project directory name, e.g. myrepo, which coincides with the GitHub repo name.
Take charge of – or at least notice! – where the Project will be saved locally. A common rookie mistake is to have no idea where you are saving files or what your working directory is. Pay attention. Be intentional. Personally, I would do this in ~/tmp.
I suggest you check “Open in new session”, as that’s what you’ll usually do in real life.
Click “Create Project”.
